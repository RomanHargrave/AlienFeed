#Example

This version of the alien client includes w3m's w3mimgdisplay program. 

The program draws images into a framebuffer so this can render images in your terminal without opening firefox (yay!)

This client uses seikichi's pyw3mimg (https://github.com/seikichi/pyw3mimg) in order to handle the w3mimg protocol

Enjoy!
